## Contests
### Chat server on Java
Serves chat messages to all chat clients that request them. Allows clients to post new messages and efficiently ping to see if a new message was posted.
### Chat client on Rust
Shows to user chat messages pulled from server. Can also post a new message. Has quite efficient implementation of pinging (listening for) new messages that might have been posted.
